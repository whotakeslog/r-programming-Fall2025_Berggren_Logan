assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}

The error that R produces when we try to run the code from class is “Error in myMean(assignment2) : object ‘someData’ not found” which is because someData is never defined and is supposed to be the length of assignment2 and because the sum of assignment is supposed to be assignment2.

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
}
myMean(assignment2)

Corrected Code with the output being 19.25
